      China- China is a country where freedom to do things online is restricted, and certain things are banned which makes me mad.

      Copyright-China is doing a good thing with the protections of intellectual property and working with the owners to ensure that they
      are really protected to the full extent of the law. With the actual regulations regarding trademark and copyright the property protected 
      can be foreign or local. This allows for a more broad form as it covers more than one actual form whether it be within that place or 
      outside; to ensure that the owner is protected. There is however an issue with Chinese knockoffs of big films; most of the time those
      films are cartoon and the creators of those knockoffs just have to change a few things to get away with things yet the resemblence
      to the original film is obvious yet those knockoff creators state that they were inspired and wanted to create something similiar.
